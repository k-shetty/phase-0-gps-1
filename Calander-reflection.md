What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't sure about when or how often to create a new branch. I was also unclear about merging and deleting branches.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I learned that creating and deleting branches is a bit of a personal choice and in a working environment, creating a new branch for each feature would be best.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I got a bit confused with the cloning process and ended up creating a repository in another repository. This led to a bunch of questions....mainly how to undo such a blunder.

What still confuses you about Git?

Still a little confused with all of the git commands, but they are starting to make more sense.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

As I am repeating phase 0, this wasn't my first experience. Regardless, the experience was good and I learned a bit more about Git and GitHub.
