What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to the GPS, I was still a little unsure about using git fetch. I'm also still working on truly understanding what happens when multiple people are pushing to a single repo. Aside from these two things, the rest of git seems pretty understandable.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

After working on the GPS assignment, using git fetch seemed to make more sense to me, as well as the cycle of pushing and pulling from GitHub.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my guide questions regarding git fetch, since I'm still acclimating myself to using the tool. I also ended up asking my guide about the syntax for adding an image in markdown. The questions I asked my pair were more related to the work that we had done last week, especially with some of the rules for markdown.

What still confuses you about Git?

As for the basic functions of Git, I think I'm pretty good. I'm still a little confused with troubleshooting with Git, like with what happened earlier in my GPS session. Without the guide to show us how to fix the problem that occurred (repo inside a repo), the issue would have taken a while to resolve. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I really liked it. Having a guide that can assist you when you need help really helps facilitate an environment which fosters learning. It removes a layer of stress that would normally come along with group work. I am definitely looking forward to my next session.
